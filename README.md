# NDEx Jupyter Notebook Tutorials
This repository contains tutorials and code examples to work with networks using the [``ndex2``](https://ndex2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python client and NiceCX object class. 

The tutorials require Python 3.6+ and the ``ndex2`` module . See the [ndex2 GitHub repo](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex2-client#readme) for installation instructions.



## [ndex2 Client v2.0 Tutorial](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/NDEx2%20Client%20v2.0%20Tutorial.ipynb)
In this tutorial you will learn to use the [``ndex2``](https://ndex2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python client. It is a module that simplifies access to the ``NDEx`` Server API and provides convenience methods for common operations on networks.

## [Style and Edit an NDEx Network](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Style%20and%20Edit%20an%20NDEx%20Network.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to:
* Load a network from ``NDEx``
* Copy and apply a visual style from an existing template in ``NDEx``
* Save (upload) the modified network to your ``NDEx`` account
* Apply a layout
* Save (update) the modified network to your ``NDEx`` account

## [Edit an NDEx Network Using NetworkX and Save as a New Network](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Edit%20an%20NDEx%20Network%20Using%20networkx%20and%20Save%20as%20a%20New%20Network.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to:
* download a network from ``NDEx`` as a ``NiceCX`` network
* make a ``networkxGraph()object`` via the to_networkx(mode='default') method
* display the networkx network
* remove 0 degree nodes
* create a new ``NiceCX`` network from the modified networkx network
* upload the new network to **NDEx**.

This notebook is available for CX2 format [here](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/CX2Network%20prune%20zero%20degree%20nodes.ipynb).

## [Find Subgraphs of NDEx Networks with Neighborhood Queries](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Find%20Subgraphs%20of%20NDEx%20Networks%20with%20Neighborhood%20Queries.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to find subgraphs of **NDEx** networks based on queries in which a list of strings is applied to a network. The result returned is a ``CX`` network containing nodes whose names match one of the strings and nodes that are "nearby" in the network, the "neighborhood" subgraph. A common use for these queries is to find subgraphs of an interactome based on a list of gene names.

## [Five Ways to Create NiceCX networks](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Five%20ways%20to%20create%20NiceCX%20networks.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to create a ``NiceCX`` network from:
* An Empty Network
* A CX File
* An NDEx Networks
* A NetworkX Network
* A Pandas DataFrame

This notebook is available for CX2 format as part of [CX2Network Tutorial](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/CX2Network%20Tutorial.ipynb).

## [Using NDEx Network Sets](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Using%20NDEx%20Network%20Sets.ipynb)
``Network Sets`` are used to group networks. They are essentially sets of "bookmarks", where a network can belong to many different sets, created by different users. This notebook shows how to:
* Get a network set
* Operate on the networks in a set
* Create a network set
* Add a network to a set
* Remove a network from a set
* Rename a network set
* Delete a network set

## [Access Node, Edge, and Network Attributes in NiceCX](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Access%20node%2C%20edge%2C%20and%20network%20attributes%20in%20NiceCX.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to access the elements of the ``NiceCX`` network object.

This notebook is available for CX2 format [here](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/CX2Network%20Navigating%20the%20network.ipynb).

## [Protocol 3: Working with NDEx Networks in Python](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Working%20with%20NDEx%20Networks%20in%20Python.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to perform simple operations on networks stored in ``NDEx``, using the [``ndex2``](https://ndex2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) client and ``NiceCX`` class. This notebook is part of the publication: "NDEx: Accessing Network Models and Streamlining Network Biology Workflows" (Curr Protoc. 2021 Sep;1(9):e258. doi: [10.1002/cpz1.258](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpz1.258)).

## [Create an NDEx Network with Data Extracted from PubMed](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Extract%20data%20from%20PubMed.ipynb)
In this notebook, we show how to extract information from PubMed records using the [``Element Tree XML``](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html) API, organize it in a ``Pandas`` dataframe and save it to ``NDEx`` as a network. The starting point of the notebook is a short list of PubMed IDs (PMIDS), so this example doesn't include any code to query the PubMed API.

This notebook is available for CX2 format [here](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/CX2Network%20Extract%20data%20from%20PubMed.ipynb).

## [How to Reset Continuous Mappings in an NDEx Network using py4cytoscape](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/p4c-NDEx%20-%20Set%20continuous%20mapping%20on%20edge%20width.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to reset the values used in a continuous mapping to match the actual range of values in the data rather then using the range of values present in the style template. This is achieved by using [``py4cytoscape``](https://py4cytoscape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to control the [``Cytoscape``](https://cytoscape.org) desktop application.
